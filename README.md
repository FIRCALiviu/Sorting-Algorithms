# Sorting-Algorithms
- If you are just interested in the results, open the jupyter notebook and read the report. 
- If you want to derive the results.txt file yourself, run in order the following scripts:
  1. compiler.py
  2. generator.py
  3. tester.py
- You may need to change _some_ of the shell commands, because they assume they are working with .out files instead of .exe files 
- The algorithms were tested using wall-clock time, not cpu time
